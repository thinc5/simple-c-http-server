# simple-c-http-server
A very, very simple http server written in C to consume github webhooks and do things.

## Rationale
Can I build a small binary that largely follows the suckless philosophy which can handle my limited continuous integration needs?

## To do
- Multi-threading
- HTTP/Request filtering (rules that dictate action)
- Allow forking shell scripts for more complex actions
